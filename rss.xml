            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fence Job</h1><p>The fence supplies I ordered from F.E.Hart Fence  Company in Williston, VT. which they delivered to Plattsburgh. They built the fence to my measurements as needed, which was very nice, the post were done beautifully, customer service was great also. Yet one of the transitional 4 foot to 6 foot sections of fence was built back words, I had no time to send it back lucky I'm a woodworker and the fix was very easy for me. This being said the fence other then that was built good, but for the cost 8,000 dollars I know how fast and easy it was to build. In my opinion they were way over priced, there's a line between making a profit and doing something entirely different. Yet a good, and strong product.             </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2cec4825161d1a12e8abe547cf7dab5d4fef9080.jpg"></article>]]></description>
